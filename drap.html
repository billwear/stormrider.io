<h2>"Debugging Rhapsody"</h2>
    <p>
Is this the real code?</br>
Is this just an old pull?</br>
Caught in a bug storm,</br>
No escape from reality.</br>
Open v-i, look up all the arguments!</br>
</br>
I'm just a coder,</br>
I need no flowcharts,</br>
Cause it's easy fix, easy code,</br>
Breakpoint here, watchpoint there.</br>
Just look at the stack frame,</br>
Nothing else will matter to me at all.</br>
</br>
Bossman, there's a-nother bug</br>
It's the fourth one yet today,</br>
They don't ever go away.</br>
Bossman, we were gonna ship,</br>
But now we'll have to hold another day</br>
</br>
Bossman, ooo-ooo-ooo-oooo,</br>
Didn't mean to make you cry,</br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow</br>
Look for me at IBM,</br>
Cause there it doesn't matter.</br>
</br>
Too late, there's another one,</br>
Sends shivers down my spine,</br>
Get exceptions all the time.</br>
Hello, new library, old one's got to go,</br>
Gotta get a fresh compile and face the truth.</br>
</br>
Bossman, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooooo,</br>
Why'd he have to quit?</br>
Sometimes I wish I'd called in sick last week.</br>
</br>
I see a little code exception in the script.</br>
It's SEGV! It's SEGV! Will we ever frickin' find it?</br>
Crashing app and mem fault, very, very bad halt! Oh!</br>
(Re-regression) Re-regression, (Re-regression) Re-regression, Re-regression in the code.</br>
</br>
I'm just a coder, nobody loves me.</br>
He's just a coder from a small college,</br>
Spare him his time from this monstrosity.</br>
Easy code, easy crash, will you just compile?</br>
"Sym-bol not found!" No I won't compile!</br>
"Sym-bol not found!" No I won't compile!</br>
"Sym-bol not found!" No I won't compile!</br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</br>
Try some printfs, try some printfs, try some printfs, just compile!</br>
This emacs has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!!!</br>
</br>
So you think you can change jobs and spit in my eye?</br>
So you think you can drop code and leave me to die?</br>
Short-timer, take your two weeks and shove it.</br>
Just gotta get out, go on and get out of here!</br>
</br>
Really doesn't matter, anyone can see,</br>
All this code is python,</br>
All that's wrong is this parenthese.
