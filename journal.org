I've kept a plaintext journal since mid-1989.  It's evolved, from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi][vi]] to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] to [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html][org-mode]], but looked bascially the same.

There are a lot of prior years' journals on a thumb drive, /someplace/.  Nevermind those for now, I'll just start posting from here.  No guarantee they'll be interesting, except maybe in an offhanded, slice-of-life, peeping-at-webcams kinda way.  YMMV, y'all.
