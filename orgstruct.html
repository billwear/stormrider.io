      tying my org file to time

    <h3>
      trying to trick entropy with organized chaos

      Closet organizers notwithstanding, the universe tends toward disorder. To paraphrase the bard, "All our Saturdays have lighted fools right back to the same messy house."  Outlines, like closets, get messy again; after all, the real world is messy, and models have limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      My very first org-mode outlines were rational and artistic masterpieces -- for about an hour.  I tried to outline my life, asterisk by asterisk, only to discover problems when loading it with reality.  Gaps spanned levels; parallel constructs were impossible to maintain; some things just didn't precisely adapt to a hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to a many-month oscillation between using the org-file and reorganizing it.  When I couldn't figure out where something fit, I'd spend a few days just cramming things at the bottom, at level 1, and assigning an approximate schedule so I wouldn't lose them.  As the file became chaotic, I'd then sit down and try to re-outline, a process that was half adjusting and half reimagining.  Eventually, this virtual circle became tiresome.
    </p>
    <h2>
      latching onto time
    </h2>
    <p>
      I can't remember how I hit on the idea of using time as reference point; I might have even seen someone else's blog about it.  What I do know is that this should have been more obvious, since time -- as a nonexistent, universal reference point measured by clocks -- is essentially immutable.  Whatever you can tie to a specific time, or more precisely, to a specific <em>type</em> of time, is somewhat easier to find, and much easier to place in an outline. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's skip over my sophomoric first attempts, and cut straight to my durable outline:

      <ul>
	<li>wife's schedule</li>
	<li>daily routines</li>
	<li>weekly routines</li>
	<li>monthly routines</li>
	<li>irregular tasks</li>
	<li>expedient tasks</li>
	<li>special days</li>
	<li>supporting schedules</li>
	<li>random thoughts</li>
	<li>gratitude</li>
	<li>auto-worry list</li>
	<li>when i have a little time</li>
	<li>when i have a half an hour</li>
	<li>when i'm bored</li>
	<li>when i feel like coding</li>
	<li>when i feel like writing</li>
	<li>when i need a mental break</li>
      </ul>

      As you can see, these things are tied to <em>some</em> kind of time, whether it's objective or subjective.  My wife's schedule is at the top because it dictates a lot of my other choices.  She's a nurse, so her schedules vary, so if I know she's going to be gone on a particular night, it gives me a good idea of the type of projects I can undertake.  Likewise, when she's here, I want to minimize some activities so I can spend time with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily, weekly, and monthly are self-explanatory.  There is one trick I use with daily tasks, which is to assign something I'm putting off as a daily task, so I have to acknowledge it every day.  Eventually, I'll get it done, mainly because I get tired of moving it forward every day.  Irregular tasks are things that are either (1) on an irregular schedule, like a doctor's appointment, or (2) have some period dictated by reality, like trimming my fingernails (every 13 days seems to work okay).  I also use this schedule for following up with friends online: family I contact every couple of days; friends every four to eight days, depending on what feels right; and acquaintances every 10-12 days, again depending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expedient tasks is one of the real gems.  If I remember a one-off task, like sending a friend a check for something I bought from them, or picking up the limbs that fell in the yard, this is my go-to niche.  If I'm even the least bit uncertain about whether the task <em>might</em> fit somewhere else, I'll pop it in here.  When I see that it has a repeat pattern, I can easily move it to another bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the curious, "supporting schedules" is my reference file, including logs of vital signs, IP addresses, and anything that can be tabulated or listed, but isn't a TODO item.  The item "random thoughts" is for anything that comes up that I want to capture, but have no idea what I'll do with it. The heading "gratitude" is my morning gratitude list, which I fill in first thing, at the direction of my therapist. And "auto-worry list" is my own idea: If something keeps worrying me, I write it into this list and largely forget about it.  It's kinda like a <code>/dev/null</code> for my anxiety.
    </p>
    <h3>
      mood-based lists
    </h3>
    <p>
      The other lists are based on my available time or my moods.  I have two bad habits that often prevent me from using my time wisely.  The first is that I see little bits of time, like 5-10m or half an hour, and feel like there's no point in getting started with anything, because I'll just get interupted, and that will feel terrible.  The second problem is that I sometimes let my mood control me, that is, I get bored with something and I just quit working on it, only to feel terrible 2 hours later when I've surfed away a whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, sometimes I put things on my schedule when I plan my day, but my moods don't match.  At work, I am responsible for both coding and writing.  These moods don't have a particular time of day -- they're related to a combination of other things, like how many meetings I've had, how many urgent things I've dealt with in the last couple of hours, whether I slept well, upcoming things I need to deal with, and so on.  I don't even try to deconstruct these anymore, I've just learned to recognize how I feel and what I'd rather be doing right now.
    </p>
    <h3>
      a durable peace
    </h3>
    <p>
      I guess that's the core of my system: link tasks not to a <em>life</em>-based outline, but to a <em>time</em>-based outline.  Some of those times are objective, some are subjective, and a couple are sort of in-between.  The real point, I think, is that I've been using this outline successfully for many months now, and it has completely stopped the oscillation and rethinking.
