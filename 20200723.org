Late journaling today, but not late getting started.  New schedule is right on time, pushing more trivial things until later in the day so I can sleep in and take advantage of my daily groove (afternoon and evening).  Just a quick pop-in to start the day's notes, i'm getting ready for a show-and-tell session on my ~xpub~ tool.
